ðŸ§  General Insights:
AI/ML skills like Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face are lucrative due to their alignment with deep learning and generative AI.

Infrastructure & DevOps tools (e.g., Terraform, Puppet, Ansible) are increasingly valued as data roles become more full-stack.

Legacy & Niche tools (e.g., SVN, Perl) often pay high due to scarcity of experts.

Languages like Scala and Go show the growing overlap between data analysis and backend engineering.
